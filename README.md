## About 42
```
 42 is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer programming school that proposes a new
 way of learning: no teachers, no books, students learning one from others (peer to peer learning),
 with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills.
 The "C Piscine" is a 26-day C programming bootcamp, and the last stage in the selection process
 for becoming a 42's student.
```
## Skills developed at C Piscine

### Hard-skills
	# C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

	# Shell
		The first two days are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	# Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
		be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-skills
	# Self-learning and proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The "pisciners" are free to work whenever they want, which demands excellent
    	time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the massive load
    	of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.

## Sobre
```
 42 √© uma escola de programa√ß√£o privada, sem fins lucrativos e sem propinas que prop√µe uma nova forma 
 de aprender: sem professores, sem livros, estudantes
 aprender uns com os outros (Aprendizagem peer to peer),
 com uma metodologia que desenvolve tanto a computa√ß√£o como skills para a vida.
 A "C piscine" √© um bootcamp de programa√ß√£o em C de 26 dias, e o √∫ltimo est√°gio no processo de sele√ß√£o
 para ser um aluna da 42.
```
## Skills desenvolvidas na C Piscine

### Hard-skills
	# Linguagem C
		A principal lignuagem aprendida na Piscine √© C: lidar com vari√°veis,
		ponteiros, alloca√ß√£o de mem√≥ria, macros, assim como criar fun√ß√µes e programas,
		incluindo o uso e cria√ß√£o de bibliotecas e Makefiles.

	# Shell
		Os primeiros dois dias s√£o dedicados a aprender comandos Shell b√°sicos e intermedi√°rios
		para facilmente navegar pelo terminal.

	# Git
		Todos os projetos s√£o submitidos atrav√©s de um reposit√≥rio git remoto, o que requere que os estudantes
		saibam trabalhar facilmente com esse sistema.

### Soft-skills
	# Auto-aprendizagem e proatividade
		Na 42, auto-aprendizagem √© o n√∫cleo da sua metodologia peer to peer.N√£o h√°
		professores; o processo de aprendizagem √© baseado em pesquisa, perguntar
		aos teus colegas, e conhecimento emp√≠rico, cada estudante aprendenddo ao seu ritmo.

	# Trabalho em equipa
		Aos fins de semana, um projeto de equipa de 48h chamado "Rush" √© proposto: grupo de 3 menbros selecionados 
		aleatoriament escolhidos pelo sistema da escola, devem colaborar para desenvolver uma aplica√ß√£o em pleno 
		funcionamento. O maior desafio do projeto √© equilibrar os diferentes n√≠veis de conhecimento enquanto encontram 
		uma metodologia de trabalho comum que permita que todos os menbros contribuam para o projeto.

	# Gerenciamento de tempo e resili√™ncia
		Os "pisciners" s√£o livres para trabalhar quando quiserem, o que requere excelente
    	habilidades de gerenciamento de tempo e resili√™ncia para n√£o se "afogarem" no meio da imensa quantidade
    	de trabalho exigido pelo impar√°vel programa de 26 dias.

## About 42

	42 is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer programming school that proposes a new
	way of learning: no teachers, no books, students learning one from others (peer to peer learning),
	with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills.
	The "C Piscine" is a 26-day C programming bootcamp, and the last stage in the selection process
	for becoming a 42's student.

## Skills developed at C Piscine

### Hard-skills
	# C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables,
		pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs,
		including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.

	# Shell
		The first two days are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate
		shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	# Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students to
		be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-skills
	# Self-learning and proactiveness
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly
		chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a
		common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The "pisciners" are free to work whenever they want, which demands excellent
    	time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the massive load
    	of work demanded by the non-stop 26-day program.
